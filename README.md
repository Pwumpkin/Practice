# Practice

Being a new software developer with a lack of development experience,
I've decided to create a central repository containing all of the practice
code I've written. The goal here is to learn proper version control via. Git,
using a **larger than usual** amount of files than I usually work with.

Ideally, this repo will *eventually* become a organized chronology of me teaching myself
new technologies.
