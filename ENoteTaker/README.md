#ENoteTaker
## Intro
ENoteTaker is my attempt at creating a small web application that can help students
take notes more effectively. Out of all the ways of taking notes, some methods
are more efficient/effective at organizing information in useful ways. ENoteTaker
provides a easy to set up, and intuitive way to take large amounts of notes.

## What does it do:
Students can use ENoteTaker to take notes efficiently.
* ENoteTaker helps by providing notebook page templates for efficient note taking methods.
* ENoteTaker lets Students organize their notes into Notebooks

## Technologies
As a small app, ENoteTaker should be able to run fairly fast within a browser on the client side only.

The project is my attempt at creating a complete AJAX notetaking application using
the fundamentals of web-dev Technologies: HTML5, CSS, and JS.
