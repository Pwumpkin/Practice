#ENoteTaker
## Intro
While searching for effective note taking strategies on the internet,
I've stumbled upon Thomas Frank's video on 5 effective note taking strategies.

## Motivation
Although there are many good note taking apps out there on the market like OneNote and Evernote,
note taking customization features usually require a paid subscription. ENoteTaker is an attempt
at providing customizable and effective note taking in an open source package.

## Technologies used:
This project is my attempt at creating a complete AJAX notetaking application using
the basics of web development: HTML5, CSS, and JS.
