# Purpose
A notebook is created with a collection of individual pages. Some types of notetaking methods are more efficient than others,
and as such ENoteTaker attempts to supply a wide range of notebook page templates for good notetaking.

## Notebook types that are currently supported:
1. **The Cornell Note Taking Style:**
  The Cornell Notetaking Method splits a page into 4 main sections:
  * The Intro(sits right on top of the page), provides a 1~2 word summary of the Main Topic

  * The Notes(sits within right 1/2 of page), are jot notes which are listed in the order of the lecture
  * The Summary(page footer) serves to summarize the whole topic.
2. **The Mind Map Method:**
  The Mind Map is diagram that acts as a very efficient note taking tool.
  *Mind Maps should be able to fit witin a notebook page.*
